- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArpAquino
- 👀 I’m interested in environmental science and geology but I want to learn programming and hoped that I could balance working and learning both geology and programming
- 🌱 I’m a newbie in programming. I don't like to code so maybe I'll go for a career path in Business Analyst or Data Analyst but still open to learn coding 😋
- I'm also trying to upskill in GIS to have various career opportunities in the future 
- 📫 You can reach me here and also in my email: arpaquino14@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Currently, working as a Junior Exploration Geologist while studying for the licensure exam 🤩

- I'm just a person who wants to know about stuff in this world 🧐
